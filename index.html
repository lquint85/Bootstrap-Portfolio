            <p> Hello! Welcome! If you have reached this page in error, it's ok, the world wide web is vast and takes you
                to funny and odd places like this one. Do not fret. I have made a portal to another far more intelligent
                and stunning world/page; just click on the link to be redirected.
                <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Mundo-2.0</a> I guess here is the part I start to talk myself
                up.
            </p>

            <p> I was born and raised in chicago. I attended the University of Illinois at Chicago for my undergraduate studies
                in Criminology, Law and Justice and graduted in 2010 with my B.A. Since then I have tried to keep myself
                busy learning such programs like adobe illustrator and photoshop only to realize that learning how to code
                and becoming a fullstack web developer is really where its at.
            </p>

            <p> I know this will be tough but I am up for the challenge and hope that my diligence and voracious appetite
                for web development will prevail
            </p>
